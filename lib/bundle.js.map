(That would\\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\\n//\\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\\n//\\n// Here's how this works:\\n//\\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\\n//\\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\\n//\\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\\n//\\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\\n\\nmodule.exports = Transform;\\n\\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\\n\\n/*<replacement>*/\\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\\n/*</replacement>*/\\n\\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\\n\\n\\nfunction TransformState(options, stream) {\\n  this.afterTransform = function(er, data) {\\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\\n  };\\n\\n  this.needTransform = false;\\n  this.transforming = false;\\n  this.writecb = null;\\n  this.writechunk = null;\\n}\\n\\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\\n  ts.transforming = false;\\n\\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\\n\\n  if (!cb)\\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\\n\\n  ts.writechunk = null;\\n  ts.writecb = null;\\n\\n  if (!util.isNullOrUndefined(data))\\n    stream.push(data);\\n\\n  if (cb)\\n    cb(er);\\n\\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\\n  rs.reading = false;\\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n\\nfunction Transform(options) {\\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform))\\n    return new Transform(options);\\n\\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\\n\\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(options, this);\\n\\n  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\\n  var stream = this;\\n\\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\\n\\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\\n  // sync guard flag.\\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\\n\\n  this.once('prefinish', function() {\\n    if (util.isFunction(this._flush))\\n      this._flush(function(er) {\\n        done(stream, er);\\n      });\\n    else\\n      done(stream);\\n  });\\n}\\n\\nTransform.prototype.push = function(chunk, encoding) {\\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\\n};\\n\\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\\n// override this function in implementation classes.\\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\\n//\\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\\n// to the readable side.
